        <p>The following box is a mystery box. It can contain anything from $0 to $0 or even a pencil !</p>
        <p>Opening this box requires a small fee of $70 (yes, definitely a really small amount)</p>
        <p>Do dare to continue? Research shows that only 2% of people can (definitely not a mobile game advertisement)</p>
        <p>Click on the box to continue</p>
